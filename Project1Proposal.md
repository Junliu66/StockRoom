## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract


*Tracking the lifecycle and quantity of parts used in a manufacturing company.*

This project will allow a small manufacturing company keep track and maintain their stockroom, by warning them of shortages in their supply or informing them of when their stocks are running low so they can avoid shortages in the future. If your company gets an order for a product to be built, it makes it easier for an employee to kit the necessary parts for manufacturing, warn the Purchasing Department of missing parts for that product that need to be purchased and notify the Shipping and Receiving of where the received parts are needed before the rest gets put in the stockroom. Allows Manufacturers to request the extra parts they need and gain visibility on when they are unable to finish their products. Finally, our project can also give a supervisor an "at a glance" view of the company by showing what parts are coming in, what products are being made, and what is ready to be shipped.


### 1.2.	Target Customer 

Our target customer would be owners of small to medium sized manufacturing companies, or any company that has to maintain and keep track of a stockroom for their business. Our project would like to have custom UIs for the different roles that the users might have within the company, such as a page for purchasing, shipping and receiving, stockroom manager, manufacturers, and supervisors.

### 1.3.	Search Words 

stockroom manager, inventory management, inventory system, inventory management software, inventory control software, inventory, stockroom, manufacturing company software, manufacturing

### 1.4.	Scope and Objectives 

- A MySQL Database
- A Graphic User Interface
- Sanitizing and handling user inputs
- Creating complex and scalable SQL queries
- Creating individual UIs for Purchasing, Shipping and Receiving, Manufacturers, Kitters, Stockroom and Supervisors

## 2.0	Team and Constraints

### 2.1.	Team profile<br>

***Chunlei Li***<br>
**Qualifications:**:I finished Java 1A classes，also had an experience work at a company that really need some good software to help with their stock managing. That’s why i feel like it will be super helpful if we could create the software that can deal with the similar issue that may happen in any companies. It will definitely save lots of manfully work and lower the miscounting or recording on any similar stocking system of  the companies, such as libraries, community services, manufactories.
 <br>
**Strengths**: I believe I have a strong sense of responsibility, especially when we work as a team. Also, great communication skill. I could learn new things efficiently with full of energy. I always have a positive attitude to life and like new challenges, because it feels fantastic when i could figure difficulty problems out.
<br>

***Stefano Mauri***	<br>
**Qualifications:**: Experience in Java, MySQL and HTML<br>
**Strengths**: Personal experience working as a stockroom manager and in shipping and receiving for a small business.<br>

***Christian Wookey***<br>
**Qualifications:**: Programming Experience: Objective-C, C, C++, Python, Lua. Design Experience: Adobe Photoshop, Krita, Adobe Illustrator, iOS design standards.<br>
**Strengths**: I have experience programming for UI/UX design. I do graphical design on a semi-regular basis. I have experience working in an Amazon Prime warehouse, which uses a virtual inventory system similar to the one we are implementing.<br>

***Junliu Zhang***	<br>
**Qualifications:**: I have taken some Java courses before. So I basically know how to use Java for programming. I also learned knowledge about quality assurance, which is quite related to software engineering. Moreover, I had some project experience in the school and company which gave me the idea of how the project works. My accountant experience also let me understand the importance of shipping and tracking products for a company and provided me the insight of how to make  stockroom system better.<br>
**Strengths**: I’m a quick learner and work well under pressure. I’m responsible to my work and take every small part seriously. Honestly I’m good at working on some small parts and able to find some small mistakes on them. I’m a very gentle and thoughtful person and I believe I can be a good team member as well. <br>

***Andre Zhu***<br>
**Qualifications:**: <br>
**Strengths**: <br>


### 2.1.	Challenges

- One of the main challenges we will face is creating good scalable SQL queries that will work with larger databases that the customer might use.

- Sanitizing inputs so we are not vulnerable to SQL injections.

- Ideal goal is find a company could try to use our program do the test.

- Time frame seems short, so we have to allocate our team wisely based on our background and strength.

- It is our first time to work together, we need time to have a better understanding of each other also finish the project perfectly.


### 2.2.	Assumptions and Constraints

* Non-Technical Constraints:
  * Time Limits: 5 weeks total for the project to be done
  * Budget: project need to be done under lowest cost
  * Database: need data of shipping, receiving and inventory from company 

* Techinical Constraints:
  * Tools: MySQL for database of stockroom, IntelliJ
  * Operating System: version Windows 2000/xp or above
