## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract


*Tracking the lifecycle and quantity of parts used in a manufacturing company.*

This project will allow a small manufacturing company keep track and maintain their stockroom, by warning them of shortages in their supply or informing them of when their stocks are running low so they can avoid shortages in the future. If your company gets an order for a product to be built, it makes it easier for an employee to kit the necessary parts for manufacturing, warn the Purchasing Department of missing parts for that product that need to be purchased and notify the Shipping and Receiving of where the received parts are needed before the rest gets put in the stockroom. Allows Manufacturers to request the extra parts they need and gain visibility on when they are unable to finish their products. Finally, our project can also give a supervisor an "at a glance" view of the company by showing what parts are coming in, what products are being made, and what is ready to be shipped.


### 1.2.	Target Customer 

Our target customer would be owners of small to medium sized manufacturing companies, or any company that has to maintain and keep track of a stockroom for their business. Our project would like to have custom UIs for the different roles that the users might have within the company, such as a page for purchasing, shipping and receiving, stockroom manager, manufacturers, and supervisors.

### 1.3.	Search Words 

stockroom manager, inventory management, inventory system, inventory management software, inventory control software, inventory, stockroom, manufacturing company software, manufacturing

### 1.4.	Scope and Objectives 

- A MySQL Database
- A Graphic User Interface
- Sanitizing and handling user inputs
- Creating complex and scalable SQL queries
- Creating individual UIs for Purchasing, Shipping and Receiving, Manufacturers, Kitters, Stockroom and Supervisors

### 2.1.	Challenges

- One of the main challenges we will face is creating good scalable SQL queries that will work with larger databases that the customer might use.

- Sanitizing inputs so we are not vulnerable to SQL injections.

### 2.2.	Assumptions and Constraints
[Under what assumptions and constraints will the team adhere to?]

[**List any specific assumptions on which the project is based on and imposed constraints** that your team will be working under. Non-technical constraints could be: such as schedule and budget. Technical constraints may be design or implementation metholodogies, tools, operating system(s), hardware or software constraints.
